## HANK Modeling

Hey!

These are some attempts I've made at solving/building heterogeneous DSGE models. The included notebooks were all created while I was trying to learn these techniques, so there's a good amount of messy code/ignored algebra mistakes/uncited or wrongly cited references/etc.

I'm currently working on a larger project that will use these ideas to analyze how wealth inequality moves within the economy in response to short term buisness cycle fluctuations.

If you have any questions, comments, or anything else to day about any of this, please email me at gengelst@macalester.edu!
